Zig Beesweeper (riff on Minesweeper)

Inspired by [Coding Train Coding Challenge #71](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFU5ZlrR21E), which builds Beesweeper.

The video builds the example using [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/-mz-ePoqd).

Here, it's built using the following, which I am learning.

- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- [raylib-zig](https://ziglang.org/)
